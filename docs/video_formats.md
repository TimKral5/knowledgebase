# Video Formats

It is a common misconception that the file ending of a gives away a
full picture of what is inside it. With video files, that is not the
case. The file ending merely states what *container* is used. It does
not provide any information as to what is the format of the video,
what format the audio is and what else might be in there.

## Codecs

Codecs are compression algorithms that are applied to video streams in
order to save up disk space. The following two categories contain
lossless compression algorithms.

### Intraframe Compression

Intraframe compressions take each frame of a video individually and
stores them more efficiently.

Here are a few examples:

- M-JPEG
- ProRes
- (H.264)

### Interframe Compression

Interframe compressions compress the video as a whole by only storing
the difference from frame to frame.

Here are a few examples:

- H.264/AVC
- H.265/HEVC
- H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2

## Containers

Containers are formats that wrap around the contents of a video. The
contents of a container could be a video stream and an audio stream.
Additionally, the video may have subtitles, multiple audio streams
(eg. multiple languages/dubs) and metadata.

These are some of the more common containers:

- MP4 (.mp4)
- AVI (.avi)
- MOV (.mov)
