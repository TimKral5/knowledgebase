## What is IPERKA?

IPERKA is a project management system where the project has to go
through a set of stages that should prevent any kind of chaos or
unclarity.

The acronym IPERKA is based on german words and describes a set of
stages that a project goes through. These are the stages in both
german and english:

| German        | English     |
|---------------|-------------|
| Informieren   | to inform   |
| Planen        | to plan     |
| Entscheiden   | to decide   |
| Realisieren   | to realise  |
| Kontrollieren | to check    |
| Auswerten     | to evaluate |

## To Inform (I)

This is the first stage where the we need to obtain information about
the task at hand.

### Questions

- What is expected and what not?
- Who is going to use the solution?
- What knowledge is required to solve this task?
- What do I already know?
- What tools are at my disposal?

### Useful Methods

- Clustering
- Interview
- Question Techniques
- Mindmap
- Research
- Tables

## To Plan (P)

In this stage, several possible solutions are sketched up.

### Questions

- What are possible solutions?
- Are there any deadlines or milestones?
- Do I have to meet any target dates?
- What priorities do I have?
- How can I divide up the task into multiple smaller steps?
    - How much time is needed for each?
    - What problems could come up?
- What tools and systems are available?
- Are there any specific requirements as for quality?
- What requirement are to met generally?
- What testing has to be done?
- (in a team) Who is doing what? How do we organize ourselves?

### Useful Methods

- Time Estimate
- Effort Estimate
- Definition of Milestones

## To Decide (E)

Here, the previously created proposals are put together to a concrete
plan and course of action.

### Questions

- What exactly has to be done?
- What technologies should be used?
- Do the decisions made meet the requirements?
- Who has to approve of the final draft?
- Is the draft realistically doable?

### Useful Methods

- User Analysis
- Pro/Contra
- Preference Matrix

## To Realise (R)

This is where the draft from previous steps is put into reality. 

### Questions

- What consequences could come up in the case of any deviation from
    the original draft?
- Can the deadlines be met? Can anything be sped up?
- Do the team mates do their work according to the specifications?
- Are any additional resources required?
- What issues are coming up? Does it affect the previous course of
    action?

### Useful Methods

- Tool Documentation
- Checklists
- Eisenhower-Matrix
- Pareto Principle
- Setting Priorities

## To Check (K)

After putting the plan into reality, the work done has to be evaluated
as to whether it meets the given criteria.

### Questions

- Does the result meet the requirements?
- Could all expectations be satisfied?
- Does the result match the targeted quality?
- Are the predefined tests successful?
- Do any edits have to be made to existing documentation?
- Do any improvements have to be made?
- Who has to be informed upon completion of the task?

### Useful Methods

- Checklists
- Self Control
- Code Reviews
- Writing Tests
- Comparisons to Draft

## To Evaluate (A)

The final evaluation is about reflecting on the process itself and
issues and challenges that came up along the way.

### Questions

- What went well and why?
- What did I do well, what not? Why?
- Did any difficulties come up? What caused them?
- What do I learn from it?
- Have all goals been met? If not, why?
- Have all available resources been used optimally?
- Were the estimates accurate? If not, where did estimates deviate?
- How can I improve?
- What did I learn?

### Useful Methods

- Learning Documentation
- Closing Report
- Personal Reflection
